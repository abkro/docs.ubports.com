===========

Before starting the porting process, adequate preparation is essential. This section covers two key areas:

* Device selection - Evaluating and choosing a suitable device
* Environment setup - Setting up your development environment

For experienced developers who want to get started quickly, see the :ref:`Quick Start Guide <quick-start>`. Others may want to read through this section carefully before proceeding.
